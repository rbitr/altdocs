Done. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

**Task 034: Fix OT Boundary Convergence Bug**

**Problem:** When an `insert_text` at offset 3 was concurrent with a `delete_text` [0,3], the OT engine didn't converge. The delete expanded to [0,4] (covering the inserted character), but the insert was NOT turned into a no-op because it was at the boundary (not strictly within the range). Path A→B' gave "de" while Path B→A' gave "Xde".

**Fix:** Changed `shiftOnTie` from `true` to `false` for the delete's end position in `transformDeleteAgainstInsert` (`src/shared/ot.ts:338`). This prevents the delete from expanding to cover text inserted at its exact end boundary.

**Result:** Both paths now converge to "Xde" — the insert survives (correct, since it's outside the delete range). All 918 unit tests pass.
