Task 016 is complete. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

**Task 016: Loading States and Error Handling UI**

### Changes Made:
1. **Toast notification system** (`src/client/toast.ts`) — lightweight toast component with success/error/info variants, auto-dismiss after 3 seconds, `aria-live="polite"` for accessibility
2. **Loading spinners** — animated CSS spinner shown while fetching document list and while loading a document in the editor
3. **Fixed silent failures** — duplicate and delete operations now show error toasts on failure and success toasts on completion, instead of silently swallowing errors
4. **Save status improvements** — shows "Saving..." during auto-save/title save, "Save failed" styled in red via CSS class, proper class cleanup
5. **Button state feedback** — duplicate/delete buttons show disabled state with progress text ("Duplicating...", "Deleting...") during async operations
6. **CSS additions** — toast container positioning, spinner animation, save status color variants

### Tests Added:
- 13 unit tests for toast component (creation, types, accessibility, auto-dismiss, multiple toasts, independent timing)
- 9 e2e tests for loading states, toast notifications, save status, and button states

### Test Results:
- 361 unit tests passing
- 76 e2e tests passing (437 total)
