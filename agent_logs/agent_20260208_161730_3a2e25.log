Done. Here's what I accomplished:

**Task 038: Upload Module Test Coverage**

Added 23 tests for the previously untested `src/server/uploads.ts` module:

**parseMultipart() unit tests (13 tests):**
- Valid multipart body parsing
- Missing boundary in Content-Type
- Missing end boundary delimiter
- Missing header/body CRLF separator
- Filename extraction, missing filename fallback ("unknown")
- Missing Content-Type fallback ("application/octet-stream")
- Trailing CRLF stripping from file data
- Empty file data, binary data, large data (100KB)
- Boundary with semicolons in Content-Type

**Upload router integration tests (10 tests):**
- Successful uploads for all 4 MIME types (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
- Non-multipart Content-Type rejection
- Unsupported MIME type rejection (text/plain, application/pdf)
- File size limit enforcement (>5MB → 413)
- Malformed multipart body rejection
- Unique filename generation verification

Test count: 1067 → 1090 (all passing). Committed as `2a2e930`.
