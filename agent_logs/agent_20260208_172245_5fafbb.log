The plan is ready for review. Here's a summary:

**Task 045: Table Data Model, Insert Operation, and Basic Rendering**

This is the first of ~6 tasks to build full table support. It establishes:

- **Data model**: `TableCell` and `TableData` types, `table` block type with `tableData` field on Block
- **Operations**: `set_table_cell` for whole-cell content replacement, table creation via existing `insert_block`
- **OT**: Transform for `set_table_cell` — same-cell priority resolution, block index shifting
- **Rendering**: HTML table inside a wrapper div, with styled cells and header row
- **Editor**: Table treated as void-like block (no text input, Enter/Backspace handling), `insertTable()` method
- **Toolbar**: "Insert Table" button in the insert group
- **Validation**: Table data structure validation
- **Tests**: Comprehensive unit tests for all components

Tables will be insertable, visible, and deletable after this task. Cell editing, row/column operations, keyboard navigation, and e2e tests follow in tasks 046-050.
