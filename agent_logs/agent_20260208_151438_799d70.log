Task 033 complete. Here's a summary:

**Task 033: OT Engine Test Coverage**

- Added **90 new tests** to `tests/ot.test.ts` (35 → 125 tests)
- Total project unit tests: **918** (up from 828), all passing
- Covered all previously-untested `transformSingle` operation-type combination branches including:
  - `insert_text` vs `merge_block` and `insert_block`
  - `delete_text` vs `split_block`, `merge_block`, and `insert_block`
  - `split_block` vs all operation types (insert_text, delete_text, merge_block, insert_block, formatting)
  - `merge_block` vs text operations, formatting, and `insert_block`
  - `change_block_type` and `change_block_alignment` vs all operation types
  - `insert_block` vs all operation types
  - Formatting (`apply_formatting`/`remove_formatting`) vs `merge_block` and `insert_block`
  - Bidirectional convergence tests for 8 operation pairs
  - Position and block index transformation edge cases

- **Discovered** a boundary non-convergence edge case in the OT engine (insert at exact delete range end offset) — documented in `ideas/ot_boundary_convergence_fix.md` for future fixing
