- Added a "?" button to the toolbar that opens the panel
- Added `Ctrl+/` keyboard shortcut in the editor to toggle the panel

- Added CSS styles for the overlay, panel, categories, tables, and kbd elements
- **25 new unit tests** (22 for ShortcutsPanel, 3 for toolbar integration)
- **9 new e2e tests** covering open/close, keyboard shortcuts, content verification
- All **348 unit tests** and **67 e2e tests** passing
