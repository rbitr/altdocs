Task 025 is complete. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

**Task 025: Client-Side WebSocket Integration**

**What was built:**
1. **Editor operation hooks** — Added `onOperation()` callback and `applyRemoteOperation()` to the Editor class, with `applyLocal()` replacing all 26 internal `applyOperation` calls to emit operations to listeners
2. **CollaborationClient** (`src/client/collaboration.ts`) — Manages WebSocket connection and OT protocol per document session:
   - Inflight + buffered ops array pattern for the OT client protocol
   - Remote operations transformed against all pending local ops using `transformOperation()`
   - Tracks remote user presence and cursor positions
   - Debounced cursor position sync
3. **Shared protocol types** (`src/shared/protocol.ts`) — Extracted `ClientMessage` and `ServerMessage` types from server to shared module so both client and server can use them
4. **Main.ts integration** — Creates CollaborationClient on editor open, disconnects on navigate away, shows "Live" status indicator and remote user dots
5. **Vite WebSocket proxy** — `/ws` path proxied to `ws://localhost:3000`

**Tests:** 15 unit tests + 3 e2e tests, all 573 unit + 134 e2e passing.
