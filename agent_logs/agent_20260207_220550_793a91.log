Task 017 complete. Here's a summary of what was done:

**Task 017: Fill Unit Test Coverage Gaps**

Added 45 new unit tests for two previously-untested modules:

- **`cursor-renderer.ts`** — 26 tests covering:
  - `resolvePosition`: start/middle/end of blocks, multi-run blocks, run boundaries, list items, headings, blockquotes, horizontal rules, empty blocks, out-of-range indices, overflow offsets
  - `resolveDocumentPosition`: single/multi-run blocks, accumulated offsets, list items, block fallback, span element resolution, non-existent block IDs, nodes outside container

- **`api-client.ts`** — 19 tests covering:
  - All 6 API functions: `fetchDocumentList`, `fetchDocument`, `saveDocument`, `createNewDocument`, `deleteDocumentById`, `duplicateDocument`
  - Error handling for non-ok responses and network errors
  - URL encoding of special characters in document IDs
  - Timeout setup and cleanup behavior via AbortController

**Total unit tests: 361 → 406** | All 406 pass cleanly.

Also created 5 follow-up task files (018-022) for remaining P2 features: font size/family, text/highlight color, responsive layout, print styles, and version history.
