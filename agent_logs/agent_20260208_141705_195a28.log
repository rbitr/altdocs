**Task 026: Remote Cursor Rendering**

- **New file**: `src/client/remote-cursors.ts` — `RemoteCursorRenderer` class that manages colored caret overlays and name labels for each remote collaborator
- **Modified**: `src/client/main.ts` — integrates the renderer into the editor lifecycle (create, update on remote user changes, refresh on editor updates, destroy on navigation)
- **Modified**: `src/client/styles.css` — CSS for `.remote-cursors-container`, `.remote-cursor-caret`, `.remote-cursor-label`, `.editor-wrapper`, and print hiding
- **New tests**: `tests/remote-cursors.test.ts` (11 unit tests) + 2 new e2e tests in `tests/e2e/collaboration.spec.ts`
- **Results**: 584 unit tests + 136 e2e tests all passing
