Task 043 is complete. Here's a summary of what was done:

**Task 043: Fix change_block_type/change_block_alignment OT Convergence**

**Problem**: When two users concurrently changed the block type or alignment of the same block, the OT transform functions didn't handle the conflict — both operations passed through unchanged, causing the two OT paths to produce different results (non-convergence).

**Fix**: Applied the same priority-based resolution pattern from Task 042:
- Added `hasPriority` parameter to `transformChangeBlockType()` and `transformChangeBlockAlignment()`
- When transforming against the same operation type on the same block, the non-priority operation adopts the other's value
- This ensures both OT paths converge: `apply(apply(S, a), b') === apply(apply(S, b), a')`

**Tests**:
- Updated 2 existing `transformSingle` tests to assert correct behavior (non-priority op adopts other's value)
- Added 4 new convergence tests using `verifyConvergence()` for both same-block and different-block cases
- All 1201 unit tests passing
