Task 042 is complete. Here's a summary of what was done:

## Task 042: Fix Void Block Backspace Splice Bug + OT Convergence

### Bug Fix
- **editor.ts:490**: Replaced direct `this.doc.blocks.splice()` with a proper `delete_block` operation via `applyLocal()`. This was the last remaining path where void block deletion bypassed the OT system, causing document divergence in collaborative sessions.

### OT Convergence Fix
- **set_indent, set_image, set_line_spacing**: Added priority-based conflict resolution for concurrent same-type operations on the same block. The priority operation (a) wins — the non-priority transform adopts a's value to ensure convergence.

### Tests Added (32 new)
- 2 editor tests verifying `onOperation` callback fires with `delete_block` for HR and image void blocks
- 30 OT convergence tests covering all cross-combinations of `set_indent`, `set_image`, and `set_line_spacing` against each other and core operations (insert_text, split_block, merge_block, insert_block, delete_block, change_block_type)

### Follow-up Task Created
- **Task 043**: Fix the same convergence issue in `change_block_type` and `change_block_alignment` (pre-existing, same pattern)
