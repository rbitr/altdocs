Task 007 is complete. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

**Task 007: Formatting Toolbar** - Committed as `08e2d5c`

### What was built:
1. **`src/client/toolbar.ts`** — Toolbar component with:
   - Formatting buttons: Bold (B), Italic (I), Underline (U), Strikethrough (S)
   - Block type dropdown: Paragraph, Heading 1-3, Bullet List, Numbered List
   - Alignment buttons: Left, Center, Right
   - Active state indication on buttons reflecting current cursor formatting
   - `mousedown` preventDefault on buttons to avoid stealing editor focus

2. **`src/client/editor.ts`** — New public methods:
   - `changeBlockType()`, `changeAlignment()` — toolbar actions with undo support
   - `getActiveFormatting()`, `getActiveBlockType()`, `getActiveAlignment()` — state queries
   - `onUpdate()` — callback system for toolbar synchronization
   - `focus()` — refocus after toolbar action
   - Ctrl+D shortcut for strikethrough

3. **`src/client/styles.css`** — Toolbar CSS (groups, separators, hover/active states)

4. **`src/client/main.ts`** — Toolbar wired into the app

### Tests:
- **29 toolbar unit tests** (rendering, formatting/block/alignment actions, active state, undo)
- **18 new editor unit tests** (changeBlockType, changeAlignment, getActiveFormatting, strikethrough shortcut, onUpdate callbacks)
- **9 e2e tests** (toolbar visibility, button actions, select changes, active state sync)
- **All 244 unit tests + 16 e2e tests passing**
