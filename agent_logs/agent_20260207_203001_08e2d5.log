Task 008 (Cut, Copy, Paste) is complete. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Task 008: Clipboard Operations — Complete

### Changes Made

**Model layer** (`src/shared/model.ts`):
- Added `getTextInRange(doc, range)` — extracts plain text from a document range, handling single-block and multi-block selections with newline separators between blocks

**Editor class** (`src/client/editor.ts`):
- Added `getSelectedText()` — public method to get selection as plain text
- Added `handleCopy()` / `handleCut()` / `handlePaste()` — native ClipboardEvent handlers bound to the contenteditable container
- Added `pasteText(text)` — public method supporting single-line and multi-line paste; multi-line splits on `\n` and creates new blocks via `split_block` + `insert_text` operations
- All clipboard mutations integrate with the undo/redo history

### Tests Added
- **8 unit tests** for `getTextInRange` (single block, multi-block, empty range, multiple runs)
- **14 unit tests** for editor clipboard (getSelectedText, single-line paste, multi-line paste, undo/redo)
- **5 e2e Playwright tests** (copy+paste, cut+paste, multi-line, no-selection copy, undo after paste)

### Test Results
- **266 unit tests** — all passing
- **21 e2e tests** — all passing
