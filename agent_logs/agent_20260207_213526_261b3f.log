Done. Here's what was accomplished in Task 013:

**Task 013: Document Management (Rename, Delete, Duplicate)**

### Changes made:
1. **DELETE API endpoint** (`src/server/api.ts`) — Wired up the existing `deleteDocument()` DB function to `DELETE /api/documents/:id`, returns 204 on success or 404 if not found
2. **Client API functions** (`src/client/api-client.ts`) — Added `deleteDocumentById()` and `duplicateDocument()` functions
3. **Editable document title** (`src/client/main.ts`) — Added an input field above the toolbar that allows renaming documents, with debounced auto-save (500ms)
4. **Document list actions** (`src/client/main.ts`) — Each document now has Duplicate and Delete buttons; delete shows a confirmation dialog; duplicate copies content with "(Copy)" suffix
5. **CSS styles** (`src/client/styles.css`) — Styled the title input, action buttons, untitled indicator (italic gray), and danger button hover state
6. **3 new API tests** for the DELETE endpoint (successful delete, 404, isolation)
7. **9 new e2e tests** covering title editing/persistence, delete with confirm/cancel, duplicate creation/content verification, and list action visibility

### Test results:
- **287 unit tests** — all passing
- **48 e2e tests** — all passing
