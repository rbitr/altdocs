Task 014 is complete. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

**Task 014: Extended Formatting**

Added four P2 extended formatting features:

1. **Block quotes** — New `blockquote` block type, renders as `<blockquote>` with left border styling, selectable from the block type dropdown.

2. **Horizontal rules** — New `horizontal-rule` block type, renders as `<hr>`, insertable via toolbar button. Special behavior: Enter creates a new paragraph after it, Backspace deletes it, character input is blocked.

3. **Inline code** — New `code` flag on `TextStyle`, renders as `<code>` tags with monospace background. Toggle via Ctrl+` keyboard shortcut or toolbar button.

4. **Code blocks** — New `code-block` block type, renders as `<pre><code>` with monospace font and gray background, selectable from the block type dropdown.

**Changes:**
- `src/shared/model.ts` — 3 new block types, `code` style, `insert_block` operation
- `src/client/renderer.ts` — Rendering for all new types
- `src/client/editor.ts` — Ctrl+` shortcut, HR insert/Enter/Backspace handling
- `src/client/toolbar.ts` — Code button, HR button, dropdown options
- `src/client/styles.css` — Blockquote, HR, code, pre styling

**Tests:** 323 unit tests (+36 new) and 58 e2e tests (+10 new), all passing.
