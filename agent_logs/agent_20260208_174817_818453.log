Task 047 is complete. Here's a summary of what was done:

**Task 047: Add Table E2E Tests + Fix clearActiveTableCell Bug**

**New tests** (13 e2e tests in `tests/e2e/table.spec.ts`):
- Insert table via toolbar button
- Click cell to activate it (verify `.active-cell` class)
- Type text into table cells
- Backspace deletes text from cells
- Tab navigates to next cell (including row wrapping)
- Shift+Tab navigates to previous cell
- `+ Row` button adds a row
- `+ Col` button adds a column
- Table persists after save and reload
- Undo reverts table cell text input
- Pre-existing table data renders correctly (3x3 with headers + surrounding paragraphs)
- Clicking outside table deactivates cell
- Control buttons (`+ Row`, `+ Col`) are visible

**Bug fix** in `src/client/editor.ts`: `clearActiveTableCell()` was only clearing the internal state but not removing the `.active-cell` CSS class from the DOM, causing the visual highlight to persist until the next full re-render. Fixed by removing the class immediately when clearing.

**All tests pass**: 1290 unit tests + 184 e2e tests, TypeScript compiles cleanly.
