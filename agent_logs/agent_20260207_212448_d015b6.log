Task 010 is complete. Here's what was done:

**Task 010: Documentation** — Created `README.md` covering:
- Prerequisites (Node.js >= 20, npm, build-essential for native modules)
- Quick start for development (Express on :3000 + Vite on :5173)
- Production build and hosting instructions (build client, run Express, it serves static files)
- Project structure overview
- REST API reference table (4 endpoints)
- Testing instructions (vitest unit + Playwright e2e)
- Architecture summary (document model, rendering, persistence, auto-save)
- Environment variables (PORT)

All 284 unit tests and 24 e2e tests pass. Committed as `3091297` on `claude_dev`.

The `current_tasks/` directory is now empty. The remaining unstaged changes (`AGENT_PROMPT.md` modifications, `agent_logs/`) were pre-existing and not part of this task.
