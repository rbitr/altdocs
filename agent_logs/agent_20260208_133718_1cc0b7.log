Task 023 is complete. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

**Task 023: User Identity (Anonymous Persistent Sessions)**

### Server
- **Users table** (`id`, `display_name`, `color`, `created_at`, `updated_at`) with random "Anonymous {Animal} {Num}" names and cursor colors from a 12-color palette
- **Sessions table** (`token`, `user_id`, `created_at`, `expires_at`) with 30-day expiry and crypto.randomBytes(32) tokens
- **Auth API** (`src/server/auth.ts`): POST `/api/auth/session`, GET `/api/auth/me`, PUT `/api/auth/me`
- **Optional auth middleware**: extracts user from `Authorization: Bearer <token>` without rejecting unauthenticated requests

### Client
- Auto-creates anonymous session on first visit via `ensureSession()`
- Stores token in localStorage, sends with all API requests via auth headers
- **User profile bar** above the app: color dot + editable display name (click to edit, Enter to save, Escape to cancel)
- Responsive styles for tablet/mobile, hidden in print

### Tests
- 13 DB unit tests (user CRUD, session creation/expiry/cleanup)
- 11 auth API integration tests (session creation, get/update me, validation)
- 8 e2e tests (session creation, persistence, name editing, escape cancellation)
- **Total: 507 unit + 131 e2e, all passing**
