**Task 050: Security & Edge Case Test Hardening**

Added 25 new tests across three modules, bringing the total from 1340 to 1365 unit tests (all passing):

**Uploads (8 tests):**
- Path traversal attempts in filenames are safely ignored (server generates random names)
- XSS vectors (HTML, SVG, JavaScript) are rejected
- Missing Content-Type handled
- MIME type / extension mismatches handled correctly
- Special characters and null bytes in filenames are safe

**Auth (11 tests):**
- Whitespace-only display names rejected
- Unicode and HTML-containing display names work
- Non-string display_name types (number, boolean) rejected
- Whitespace trimming verified
- Malformed Authorization headers (wrong prefix, lowercase `bearer`, empty, bare `Bearer `)

**WebSocket (6 tests):**
- Unknown/empty message types don't crash connections
- Large messages (100KB) processed correctly
- 10 rapid sequential operations maintain correct version ordering
- Room cleanup verified across multiple join/leave cycles
- Operation history preserved while clients are connected
