Task 032 is complete. Here's a summary:

**Task 032: UI Component Unit Tests**

Added 83 new unit tests across 3 new test files, covering the three client UI components that previously had zero unit test coverage:

- **`tests/share-panel.test.ts`** (33 tests): Constructor/visibility, open/close lifecycle, overlay dismiss, share list rendering (empty, error, with items), permission badges, create share link flow (button states, toast feedback, list refresh), revoke flow (button states, error recovery), and copy-to-clipboard (success + failure).

- **`tests/version-panel.test.ts`** (24 tests): Open/close lifecycle, overlay dismiss, loading state, version list rendering (empty, error, with items), version labels/dates/titles, restore flow (API call, onRestore callback, panel close, loading state), and error recovery (button re-enable, panel stays open).

- **`tests/main-helpers.test.ts`** (26 tests): `generateId()` format and uniqueness, `parseHash()` with various hash formats (empty, root, doc ID, share tokens, URI encoding, multiple query params), `createLoadingIndicator()` structure and custom messages, `updateSaveStatus()` class management, auto-clear behavior, and no-element safety.

Total unit tests: **828** (up from 745). All passing.
