Done. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

**Task 040: Image Insertion E2E Tests**

Added 12 comprehensive Playwright e2e tests in `tests/e2e/image.spec.ts` covering the image insertion feature that previously had zero e2e test coverage:

- **Rendering**: Image blocks with `imageUrl` render as `<figure><img>`, blocks without show a placeholder
- **Keyboard behavior**: Text input blocked on image blocks, Enter creates paragraph after, Backspace deletes image
- **Upload workflow**: Full file chooser → upload → render flow with real PNG file
- **Persistence**: Images survive auto-save and page reload
- **Mixed content**: Images render correctly between other block types, multiple images work independently
- **Edge case**: Deleting the last image block leaves a usable paragraph

Key insight: Clicking directly on `<figure>` elements doesn't reliably position the editor cursor in headless Chromium. Tests use keyboard navigation (ArrowDown from adjacent blocks) instead.

All **1141 unit tests + 169 e2e tests** pass.
